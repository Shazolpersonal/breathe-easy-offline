## 2024-06-25 - Prevent Accidental Deletion with AlertDialog & Enhance ARIA on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons mapping to destructive actions (like delete) on cards/lists frequently lack `aria-label` tags, causing poor screen reader experiences. Simultaneously, the lack of delete confirmations leads to inadvertent data loss.
**Action:** When auditing or building user lists/cards with icon actions, ensure all buttons are wrapped in tooltips that provide explicit `aria-label`s. Always safeguard destructive actions using an `AlertDialog` (or similar confirmation patterns) linked to an intermediate state variable (e.g., `deleteTarget`), confirming user intent before executing the deletion logic.

## 2024-06-08 - Tooltips for Floating Mini-Players
**Learning:** Sighted users can easily overlook the purpose of icon-only buttons in compact floating components like the MiniPlayer, even when aria-labels are present. Using a standard Tooltip component on hover/focus significantly improves usability.
**Action:** Always wrap icon-only buttons in Tooltips (`<Tooltip> <TooltipTrigger asChild><button/></TooltipTrigger> <TooltipContent/> </Tooltip>`) to ensure both visual and semantic clarity, especially in confined spaces.
