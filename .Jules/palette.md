## 2024-06-25 - Prevent Accidental Deletion with AlertDialog & Enhance ARIA on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons mapping to destructive actions (like delete) on cards/lists frequently lack `aria-label` tags, causing poor screen reader experiences. Simultaneously, the lack of delete confirmations leads to inadvertent data loss.
**Action:** When auditing or building user lists/cards with icon actions, ensure all buttons are wrapped in tooltips that provide explicit `aria-label`s. Always safeguard destructive actions using an `AlertDialog` (or similar confirmation patterns) linked to an intermediate state variable (e.g., `deleteTarget`), confirming user intent before executing the deletion logic.

## 2024-06-25 - Search Empty States
**Learning:** When users search long lists (like Session History or Techniques) and get no results, the UI can appear broken if it just shows an empty list. We need to distinguish between "You have no data at all" and "Your search returned no results".
**Action:** When implementing or auditing search interfaces on top of lists, always include a fallback conditional render for the empty state (`filteredList.length === 0 && list.length > 0`) that clearly communicates "No results found" with an appropriate icon.
